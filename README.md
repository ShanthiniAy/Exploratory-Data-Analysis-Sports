# IPL Data Analysis

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on Indian Premier League (IPL) data. The analysis focuses on two main datasets: 'deliveries.csv' and 'matches.csv'. These datasets provide comprehensive information about IPL matches, player performances, and team statistics.

## Project Overview

IPL is one of the most popular Twenty20 cricket leagues globally, featuring top-notch international and domestic cricketing talent. This project aims to gain insights into IPL matches, players, and teams' performance through data analysis and visualization.

## Datasets

1. **deliveries.csv**: This dataset includes detailed information about each ball bowled in IPL matches, including batsman runs, extras, wickets, and more.

2. **matches.csv**: This dataset contains information about IPL matches, including match date, venue, teams, toss details, match outcome, and more.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA process involves the following steps, which are documented in the code and notebooks:

1. **Data Loading**: We load the 'deliveries' and 'matches' datasets into pandas DataFrames.

2. **Basic Data Exploration**:
   - Display basic information about the datasets.
   - View the first few rows of each dataset.
   - Calculate summary statistics for numeric columns.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Visualize distributions and trends in the data using matplotlib and seaborn.
   - Explore runs scored, dismissal types, batting strike rates, bowling economy rates, and more.

4. **Team and Player Analysis**:
   - Identify top run-scorers and successful teams in IPL.
   - Analyze the number of matches played each season.
   - Investigate toss decision statistics.

5. **Additional EDA Steps**:
   - Explore dismissal types and their frequencies.
   - Analyze batting strike rates of players.
   - Investigate bowling economy rates of bowlers.
   - Examine team performance over different IPL seasons.

## Dependencies

To run the analysis, you will need the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ipl-data-analysis.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd ipl-data-analysis
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts for data analysis.
